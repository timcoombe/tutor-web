                   <h2>The Open Strings</h2>
                    <p>If we leave out bass guitars and twelve strings, there are six strings on a regular guitar. Usually when guitarists talk about how these strings are tuned they will start from the thickest string up to the thinnest. So using this method the standard tuning is E A D G B E. </p>
                    <p>Put simply, the top string (1st string) is the thinnest and the bottom (6th string) is the thickest.</p>
                    <h2>Tuning methods</h2>
                    <h3>Electronic tuners</h3>
                    <p>
                        The easiest method of tuning a guitar is with an electronic tuner. Plug your guitar into the tuner and play an open string. The tuner will display the current note that the string is playing and show whether it is sharp(too high) or flat(too low). Adjust the tension of the string up or down using the machine head until it's perfectly in tune. Repeat with all the other strings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only downside to using an electronic tuner is that your own ears don't have to do any work, so you don't really have to listen to how it should sound. You could try tuning just the lowest (thickest) E string and then using relative tuning(see below) for the rest of the strings, to get your 'ear' in tune.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that, electronic tuners are great for live situations as no one wants to hear you tuning up between songs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nut</h3>
                    <p>The nut marks one end of the section of the string that vibrates when you strike it. The
  distance between the nut and the bridge is important. The relative distance between this and each
  of the frets makes the guitar in tune all the way up the neck.</p>
                    <h3>Frets</h3>
                    <p>The frets divide the distance between the nut and the bridge following a specific mathematical
  formula, so that pressing the string between frets makes as precise note&nbsp; as possible all the
  way up the neck.</p>
                    <h3>Bridge</h3>
                    <p>The bridge marks the other end of the vibrating part of the strings. The bridge has small screws
  which allow you to adjust the distance between it and the nut, making small changes to the
  intonation of the guitar so that it is in tune all the way up the neck.</p>
                    <h3>Pickups</h3>
                    <p>The pickups convert the sound of the strings to an electronic signal which can be sent to an
  amplifier. There will usually be one, two or three pickups. The ones nearer the neck will give a
  mellow tone and the ones nearer the bridge will give a brighter tone.</p>
                    <h3>Pickup Switch</h3>
                    <p>The pickup switch allows you to change which pickup is sending the signal. Usually you can
  choose either one pickup or two together.</p>
                    <h3>Tone and Volume Pots</h3>
                    <p>The tone pots adjust the amount of treble in the signal. The volume pots do the same for the
  volume for each pickup.</p>
                    <h3>Output Jack</h3>
                    <p>The output jack is where you put the lead, which goes from the guitar to the amplifier,
  sometimes with effects in between.</p></p>
