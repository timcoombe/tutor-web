                    <h2>The Fourth String</h2>
                    <p>Here are the first position notes on the fourth string, D.</p>
                    <h3>D on the fourth string</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/d_on_fourth_string.png" alt="D on fourth string"/></p>
                    <h3>E on the fourth string</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_on_fourth_string.png" alt="E on fourth string"/></p>
                    <h3>F on the fourth string</h3>

                    <h3>The minor pentatonic scale</h3>
                    <p>Now you have learnt the first position notes on the top four strings, you can take a first look at a really useful scale, the Minor Pentatonic. This scale is great for making up riffs, improvising over minor and major keys and playing simple blues licks.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_minor_pentatonic.png" alt="Minor Pentatonic Scale"/></p>
                    <p>Try out this pattern using the E minor pentatonic scale.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_minor_pentatonic_tune_1.png" alt="Minor Pentatonic Tune - 1"/></p>
                    <p>There are many well known songs which have made use of the minor pentatonic. Here are  just some of them:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layla - Derek and the Dominoes</li>
                            <li>Shakin' all over - Johnny Kidd and the Pirates</li>
                            <li>Whole Lotta Love - Led Zeppelin</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Introducing quavers</h2>
                    <p>A note which lasts half as long as a crotchet is called a quaver.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/quaver.png" alt="Quaver"/></p>
                    <p>When there is more than one quaver in a row they are usually tied together with a single bar as show in the following diagram. When reading a piece with quavers, count as shown on the diagram.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/quavers.png" alt="Quavers"/></p>
                    <p>Here is another E minor pentatonic pattern using quavers</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_minor_pentatonic_tune_2.png" alt="Minor Pentatonic Tune - 2"/></p>
                    <p>Two chords which work well with E minor pentatonic are E minor and D major: The E minor chord is an extension of the three string chord you played earlier.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_minor_chord.png" alt="E minor chord"/></p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/d_major_chord.png" alt="D major chord"/></p>
                    <h3>Changing chords with simple strumming</h3>
                    <p>Now you have learnt a couple of chords it's  time to practise changing between them. In the exercise below, you will strum E minor four times then D major four times and keep repeating the pattern. At first you'll probably find it hard to change between the chords and keep the rhythm going. Start really slowly, at a pace where you change from E minor to D major and back again without breaking the rhythm.  The metronome is a great tool for this. When you find a slow enough speed, you can very gradually speed it up.</p>
                    <p>Start with just down strokes. The symbol below the beginning of the tab means to play a down stroke, and the dotted line after it means carry on with the same stroke. </p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/8/e_minor_to_d.png" alt="E minor to D major"/></p>
                    <p>Now try changing between the same chords with down and up strokes. You can see the notation for playing down and up strokes below the tab. </p>
