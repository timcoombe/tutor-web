                    <p>The 6th string, E, is two octaves lower than the 1st string. Try playing  both strings, one after the other and see if you can hear the relationship between the two. Also try playing these notes with the E on the second fret of the fourth string, which is one octave between the two open E strings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip. A handy way of checking the tuning of your guitar is to test that the octaves all sound in tune.</strong></p>
                    <p>Learning the first position fingering of the 6th string is simple, as it's the same as the first string.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes when playing a piece of music, you want to leave some gaps between the notes. To show this in music notation we use 'rests'. </p>
