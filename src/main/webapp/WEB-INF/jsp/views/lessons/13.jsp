                    <h2>Blues shuffle in A</h2>
                    <p>Let's try a simple blues 'shuffle'. You'll probably recognise the rhythm straight away when you hear it, but it's a bit more difficult to explain in writing. Have a listen to these songs to get an idea:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roadhouse Blues - The Doors</li>
                            <li>Riding Along In My Automobile - Chuck Berry</li>
                            <li>Jailbait - Wishbone Ash</li>
                            <li>Down at the Doctors - Dr. Feelgood</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>To get the idea of how a shuffle is written, we'll need to learn about triplets. Triplets are written as below, with each triplet taking up one beat. Each note is written as a quaver, but actually only takes up one third of a beat. You can use the word 'evenly' to count a triplet, as in e-ven-ly, using one syllable for each note.</p>

                    <p>With a shuffle, the triplet looks slightly different, with the middle note missed out. The symbol in the middle is a rest, meaning don't play here. You can still use e-ven-ly to get the feel of the rhythm, but don't play on the middle 'ven' syllable.</p>

                    <p>For our blues shuffle, we are going to be playing 2 notes at once. Let's try a very simple version first.  Use only down strokes when you play this.</p>

                    <p>Now let's try a slightly trickier version, for which we need to learn three new notes: </p>
                    <h3>C# on the fifth string</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/13/c_sharp_on_fifth_string.png" alt="C Sharp"/></p>
                    <h3>F# on the fourth string</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/13/f_sharp_on_fourth_string.png" alt="F Sharp"/></p>
                    <h3>B on the third string</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/13/b_on_third_string.png" alt="B on third string"/></p>
                    <h3>Second Blues Shuffle</h3>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/13/second_shuffle.png" alt="Second shuffle"/></p>
