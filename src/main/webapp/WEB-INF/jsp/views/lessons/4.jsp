                    <h2>Notes on the second string</h2>
                    <p>Now you are familiar with the first string, it's time to move on to the first position notes on the second string.</p>
                    <p><strong>Playing in first position means that you start with your first finger at the first fret. When you start to move up the neck you'll use other positions.</strong></p>

                    <h3>The Minim</h3>
                    <p>So far each note you have played has lasted for one beat and these notes have been written using a crotchet. A note that lasts for two beats is written as a 'minim'. A minim looks the same as a crotchet but the circle is not filled in.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/4/minim.png" alt="Minim"/></p>
                    <p>When you play a minim, let it ring out for two beats.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="/static/lessons/4/second_string_minims.png" alt="Second String Minims"/></p>
                    <p>Try this exercise with both crotchets and minims.</p>

                    <h3>Counting</h3>
                    <p>It's a good idea when reading music to keep a count in your head. You can help this by either counting softly out loud or by tapping your foot. You can also use a metronome, which allows you to set a click going at timed intervals, which you can then speed up and slow down. If you have a smartphone, there are quite a few free metronomes available. When you are practising an exercise, start the metronome at a slow speed, about 60bpm (beats per minute). When you have played it a couple of times, speed the metronome up a bit and try again. Repeat until you can't keep up.</p>
                    <p>Now let's try playing across two strings using the notes you've learnt so far. Remember to still alternate up and down strokes, even when changing strings. Start slowly and gradually build up speed.</p>
